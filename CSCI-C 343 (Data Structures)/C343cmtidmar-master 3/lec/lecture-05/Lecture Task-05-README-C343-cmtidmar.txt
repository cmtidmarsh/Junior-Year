In order of "powerfulness" (in descending order):

1. Abstract Machine
2. Random Access Machine
3. Pointer Machine

Let's start with the most powerful and then move down to the least powerful. I put an 
Abstract Machine as the most powerful because it has the most functionality. An Abstract
Machine is made up of abstract ideas. Hence, you can have as many or as little functions
as you wish as well as your functions can be as complex or as simple as you wish too.
Since an Abstract Machine has almost an infinite amount of functions one can make at all/any
difficulty, one can consider that the Abstract Machine to be the most powerful due to the versitility
of the machine. Next, we have the Random Access Machine. The Random Access Machine is the second most powerful machine 
of the three because it can select and access specific data in the dataset to evaluate at any given 
time, hence, the random in Random Access Machine. 
Since the RAM has limited functionality compared to the Abstract Machine,
I put it in second place. Lastly, the least powerful machine is a pointer machine. The
pointer is the least powerful because it has even more limited functionality than a RAM. A pointer machine has 
to access the data in order that it is in the dataset. Unlike the RAM, the pointer machine cannot select a
certain point and access the information at that point directly. The pointer machine will have to access all
points that are before the desired point before it can access the desired data from the dataset. Due to this
functionality is more limited and the the time complexity of of the machine is longer than the RAM. Hence, the 
pointer machine being the least powerful machine of the 3.

There are few limitations to an abstract machine is the efficiency. Since the abstract machine has to go through "n" number
of steps, making the runtime to be around O(n),I would say that that is a huge limitation. 
Now, you might feel that due to how inefficient the abstract machine can be, that it should not be the most powerful. However, it is the most powerful due to the flexibility of the machine. The flexibility of the machine means that there are so many more possibilities you can use with the machine and the flexibility also makes it easy to perform any debugging. Next, a limitation of the Random Access Machine is that limited data can be stored and saved. While using a Random Access Machine, the cost per input is high, so that means there's less space, hence limited space to store and save data.
Lastly, a limitation of a Pointer Machine is that the pointer machine must access and read the data from the memory, 
then read it to the memory, making the machine to be slower. 
Since it cannot directly access the data from the memory then read it (like the RAM), that
would come to be a huge limitation as the machine is much slower.
