" Lab 16 Participation
For this Lab 16, as lab participation:
submit your own class notes for Lab 16, as from Course Syllabus:
"you'll need to take your own class notes at lecture and lab times, either handwritten or typed. We may ask you to submit
your lecture notes from a specific lecture, to verify participation (handwritten = you'll send us a scan or photo of your
notes; typed = we'll ask you to send us a plain-text (.txt or .md if you prefer to use MarkDown syntax in your plain-text
files) or PDF version of your own class notes."
For this Lab 16 participation, in your class notes, write down at least 3 items of importance that you noticed during 
Lab 16, or 3 new items that you learned during Lab 16.
Name your notes file lab-16-notes-C343-username.txt.
Due by 4:30PM on Wednesday, July 29, 2020.
Follow C343 Submission Instructions about your notes file content type, encoding, and submission.
(see Lab video if you can not attend the Zoom meeting)"

3 Items of importance:

1. The functions of a minimum spanning tree/what it does/the purpose of it
2. This lab reminded me of the importance of using System.out.println() function to test and debug lines of code
that may not work/do not give the right outcome, so you can see where you went wrong
3. Understanding how to translate pseudocode to actual java implementation code, I probably didn't do it correctly (actually, most likely)
