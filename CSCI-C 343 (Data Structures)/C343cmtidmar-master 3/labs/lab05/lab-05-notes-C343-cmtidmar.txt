For this Lab 05 participation, in your class notes, write down at least 3 items of
importance that you noticed during Lab 05, or 3 new items that you learned during Lab 05.

Items of learned:
1. Grant had Office Hours from 11:30 - 12:30 - but are those everyday or are they only when the AIs specify specifically?
2. I learned that because I really didn't do the previous tweet assignment due to time management and me having to move out of 
my apartment completely the day it was due, I found this lab to be alittle more challenging.
3. I learned that when a majority of code is given, then the assignment is actually a little harder rather than being about to
just do everything the way you would think to do it. You have to adjust, so you van utilize what is given to you.
4. I also learned that by the end of this class, I feel like I'm going to really know how to implement ArrayLists like it's second nature.
