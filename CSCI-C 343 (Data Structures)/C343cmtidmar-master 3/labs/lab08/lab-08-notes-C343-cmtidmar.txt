For this Lab 08 participation, in your class notes, write down at least 3 items of importance that you noticed during Lab 08,
or 3 new items that you learned during Lab 08.


3 items of importance:

1. For me at least, I noticed when I wrote down the algorithm of what the program is supposed to do beforehand, it made it 
easier to understand and go through what each line is supposed to do. 

2. Take a mental note, or write out comments for what each item in the starter code does, so you know what the start code
is doing like when we had to explain in the Task A portion of a part of the code.

3. Recalling exactly how to implement a hashtable/dictionary.
