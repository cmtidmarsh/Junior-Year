For this Lab 06 participation, in your class notes, write down at least 3 items of importance that 
you noticed during Lab 06, or 3 new items that you learned during Lab 06.


3 important/learned items:

1. For this assignment, it really tested my inability to make object methods. I think it is important to know how to make other
  methods other than just void and static methods, like object.
2. It is important for you to know how to set up a static array and a dynamic array and the differnences between them.
3. It is important for you to understand when it is appropriate to use either method, and it is important to understand the
time complexities of those methods so you have an idea of how it'll run when you implement either.
