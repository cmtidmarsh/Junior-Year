For this Lab 04 participation, in your class notes, write down at least 3 items of importance that you noticed during Lab 04,
or 3 new items that you learned during Lab 04.

3 items of importance:

1. find out how many times the for-loop will run then multiply that by the time complexity value of the first
inner for-loop running.

2. Don't just implement the instructions of the assigment, but rather we should clarify the steps that we do at each point
to make sure it works and to see what it is actually doing, so then it'll eventually come naturally and you'll know exactly 
what's happening.

3. To know that the upper bound is average, then the lower bound has to be equal to the upper bound.
