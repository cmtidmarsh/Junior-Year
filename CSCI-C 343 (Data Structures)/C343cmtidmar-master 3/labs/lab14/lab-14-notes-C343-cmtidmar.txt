3 itesm of importance:

1. How the Floyd algorithm works and what exactly you're trying to achieve (still do not totally understand it all)
2. How to find the shortest path
3. Can you apply the shortest path to individual components in a graph or does the graph have to be one big component, seeing
as how we just did another lab on components.
