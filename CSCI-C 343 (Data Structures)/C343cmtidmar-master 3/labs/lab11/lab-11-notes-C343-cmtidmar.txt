"Lab 11 Participation
For this Lab 11, as lab participation:
submit your own class notes for Lab 11, as from Course Syllabus:
"you'll need to take your own class notes at lecture and lab times, either handwritten or typed. We may ask you to submit
your lecture notes from a specific lecture, to verify participation (handwritten = you'll send us a scan or photo of your
notes; typed = we'll ask you to send us a plain-text (.txt or .md if you prefer to use MarkDown syntax in your plain-text
files) or PDF version of your own class notes."
For this Lab 11 participation, in your class notes, write down at least 3 items of importance that you noticed during
Lab 11, or 3 new items that you learned during Lab 11.

Due by 4:30PM on Thursday, July 16, 2020.
Follow C343 Submission Instructions about your notes file content type, encoding, and submission.
(see Lab video if you can not attend the Zoom meeting)"


3 items of importance:

1. Make sure that assignments are at 100% completion and working in order in case it is used in future assignments
2. This lab I was unsure about a lot of it but wasn't exactly sure how to phrase and ask, so I guess an important thing 
that I learned was if you really unsure, ask a TA to look at your code and clear things up?
3. Verify that you know how to implement observer and what the functions do.
