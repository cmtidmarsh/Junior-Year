For our UML diagram, we didn't have to change much on the server side as most of what we needed was already there.
On the client side, we added a Tile interface which is used when creating Tiles in the View.
Additionally we moved the timer from the model to the controller. We also needed to add Key events in our controller 
as we needed a key pressed and key released method. 
Although we needed to add some additional classes, the bulk of our implementation came in the model, view and controller
as expected. Tiles and decorators were added in order to simplify the game creation in these methods.
