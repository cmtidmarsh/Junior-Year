Lab 9: March 18, 2021 3:28pm

Compiled and ran lab01 by all members and make sure it works.

Can confirm that we created a ModelInterface and implemented it in the Controller.

In the first terminal we go in out instead of src, then production, lab09, then type rmiregistry here

In the second terminal we type java -Djava.security.policy=permit Model

In the third terminal we type java Controller

After running the server, everything works as expected.

In case, we also have a lab09 version two for the way professor taught in class which I have Client in Controller and Server in Model.
