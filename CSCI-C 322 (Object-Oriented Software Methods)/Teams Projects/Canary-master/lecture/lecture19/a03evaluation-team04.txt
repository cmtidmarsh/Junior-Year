There is a confusion with no arrow point at with the Operator in Model. 
The UML has a bad formatting according to the UML class diagram tuition, which classes and methods are not showing as they should be. 
 The arrows are also not clear in class view between those buttons.

UML Eval
Documentation: Adequate
THe UML documentation was adequate. It is clear of the relationships between all of the classes but I can’t tell the multiplicities of each. I also can’t tell exactly which side of the uml is on the server and which is on the client. Both would be helpful  


Specifications: Excellent
All specifications were met.
