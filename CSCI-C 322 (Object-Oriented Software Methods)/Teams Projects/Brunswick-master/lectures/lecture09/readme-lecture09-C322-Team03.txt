We were able to make the classes for each state, but we were unable to test out classes
	and pass the given characters to each state. A lot of our time went into trying to
	understand how the Turnstile would be applied to the switch cases. We were unable
	to produce a output.
	
We observed that it was difficult to understand at first, but after we were able to
	understand what applied to what, it was easier to implement.
