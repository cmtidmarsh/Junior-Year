Our team were able to implement the controller/view as the client program and the model as the server program
When our team attempted to run the program, each program compiled. Model was successfully granted permissions.
Unfortunately, when we ran the controller program, we received a casting error with BinaryCalculatorModel.
We were unable to fix this during lab, and had to leave the program as is. 

The model was overly complicated with multiple classes within it. I believe this caused problems with implementing RMI with the program.
