The git repo was nearly perfect but Brunswick team 1 didn't create proper labs folder for their lab04  
Read/me		Use Case	Class Diagram	Activity Digram
0.5*1 +		+ 0.5*0.8 	+ 0.5*1 	+ 0.5 * 1

Read/me:
	Isn't in a separate readme file but other wise a really good description 
0.5*1 + 0.5 * 1 = 25 points

Use Case:
	Could really benefit from arrows between the functions the user is using
	The diagram could show the difference between what functions are performed by the user and which are performed by the program itself. 
0.5 * 0.6 + 0.5 *1 = 20

Activity Digram:
	The valid number given and valid operation given gave us a hard time.
	The diagram overall shows all the possible paths the user and program could take which is good.
	The use result option is nice to continue the flow of the program. 
0.5 * 1 + 0.5 * 0.8 = 22.5

Class Diagram:
	Very well put together! The view is amazing, and good use of the observable
	Shows the relation between the model, view, and controller in a clear easy to read way.
0.5*1 + 0.5 * 1 = 25 points
