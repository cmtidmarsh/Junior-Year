HashMap<Integer, Pair<Integer, Integer>> getPlayerPositions(int except) throws RemoteException;
    the method's signature:
    
        input data and types (objects/classes), example values, and possible ranges of values (e.g. min/max expected inputs, if applicable)
        - Takes in an integer representing the playerID. MIN: 0, MAX: Number of players (-/+ 1)

        output data and types (objects/classes), example values, and possible ranges of values (e.g. min/max possible outputs, if applicable)
            - Returns HashMap<Integer, Pair<Integer, Integer>> - A hashmap of player ID's with a Pair of (X, Y) coordinates.
            - throws RemoteException A remoteException for any undefined behavior, or connection loss.

        the method's functionality: describe the functionality of each method, outlining any data processing caused by invoking the method
            - Accessing the instance variable stored within the player class

        example use: write an example of when/how the method would be invoked by the client application, and how the server would respond to that method being called.
            - getPlayerPositions(1) would return {1: (10, 10)}



void sendPlayerPosition(int playerID, int positionX, int positionY) throws RemoteException;
    the method's signature:
    
        input data and types (objects/classes), example values, and possible ranges of values (e.g. min/max expected inputs, if applicable)
            - Takes in an integer playerID with MIN: 0, MAX: number of players (-/+ 1)
            - Takes in an integer positionX MIN: 0, MAX: Size of the game board 256?
            - Takes in an integer positionY MIN: 0, MAX: Size of the game board 256?

        output data and types (objects/classes), example values, and possible ranges of values (e.g. min/max possible outputs, if applicable)
            - Has no return type
            - throws RemoteException A remoteException for any undefined behavior, or connection loss.

        the method's functionality: describe the functionality of each method, outlining any data processing caused by invoking the method
            - Sends the position of the given player from the client to the server.

        example use: write an example of when/how the method would be invoked by the client application, and how the server would respond to that method being called.
            - sendPlayerPosition(1, 10, 10) would send the coordinates (10, 10) to the server


int gatherResource(int forPlayer) throws RemoteException;
    the method's signature:
    
        input data and types (objects/classes), example values, and possible ranges of values (e.g. min/max expected inputs, if applicable)
            - Takes in an integer playerID with MIN: 0, MAX: number of players (-/+ 1)

        output data and types (objects/classes), example values, and possible ranges of values (e.g. min/max possible outputs, if applicable)
            - Returns the amount of resources that were consumed

        the method's functionality: describe the functionality of each method, outlining any data processing caused by invoking the method
            - resource used to increment player's health or number of resources
            
        example use: write an example of when/how the method would be invoked by the client application, and how the server would respond to that method being called.
            - gatherResource(3) would first increment a player's health and return 3


void updateResources() throws RemoteException;
    the method's signature:
    
        input data and types (objects/classes), example values, and possible ranges of values (e.g. min/max expected inputs, if applicable)
            - No inputs


        output data and types (objects/classes), example values, and possible ranges of values (e.g. min/max possible outputs, if applicable)
            - No output

        the method's functionality: describe the functionality of each method, outlining any data processing caused by invoking the method
            - use the given formula to generate new resources

        example use: write an example of when/how the method would be invoked by the client application, and how the server would respond to that method being called.
            - updateResources()


int[][] getResources() throws RemoteException;
    the method's signature:
    
        input data and types (objects/classes), example values, and possible ranges of values (e.g. min/max expected inputs, if applicable)
            - No inputs
            
        output data and types (objects/classes), example values, and possible ranges of values (e.g. min/max possible outputs, if applicable)
            - Returns the 2D int array that represents the board MAX: size of the array
            
        the method's functionality: describe the functionality of each method, outlining any data processing caused by invoking the method
            - return of an instance variable

        example use: write an example of when/how the method would be invoked by the client application, and how the server would respond to that method being called.
            - getResources()
