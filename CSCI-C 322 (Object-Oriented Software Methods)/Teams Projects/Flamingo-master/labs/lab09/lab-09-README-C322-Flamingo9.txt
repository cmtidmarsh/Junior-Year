TASKS COMPLETED:
	Working through step 4.

NOTES:
	The Binary Calculator works, and we initially decide to put the remote object/interface into the Controller.
	Right now it's mainly Andrew putting things together while Allie documents the process, though there aren't big hang-ups.
	The step-by-step helps but it's still difficult to keep track of what's happening where re:opening terminals.
	Running into some hang-ups. Keeping track of files and locations and names.
	We can run things, but the calculator is not being pulled up.
