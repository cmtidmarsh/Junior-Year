Lab 07

STEPS COMPLETED: 1, 2, 3, 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 5... The entire lab.

OBSERVATIONS:
	We did not need to update our UML as we only made changes within functions.
	For the DJView issue, it was defaulting to 90 even if you set it before playing. We removed a line in the on() function in BeatModel to fix this.
	To ensure that the JTextField changed with the increase and decrease buttons, we added a line that set the text within the JTextField to the updated bpm.
