We had issues with the GUI and differences between Mac and Windows, so we had to defined two different GUIs.
One that works on Mac and one that works on Windows.

Document of Changes ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our AI instructed us to document any changes we had to make to our MVC for the purpose of
functionality, what we changed is defined below:

In the UML Diagram we saw that the team seemed a little confused between the use of the View
and the Controller - We put the methods they defined in the Controller into the View and vice
versa. We tried to retain their methods to the best of our ability without sacrificing 
functionality.

There were some classes listed in the diagram (Button, Label) that were not used - the instructions
for this assignment stated "you have to use built-in Java SE components from JFC/Swing" so we
used these features instead

Expanded on the variables given in the View - they listed "input, result or operand"
We took that sentiment and had variables that had those functions, named differently though

Some methods like getClear(), displayoperandTwosubtraction(), displayoperandOneAddation() did not seem to have functionality,
so we redifined methods for what we thought the group wanted

Other than that, we tried to replicate the UML diagrams as much as possible - we retained most of
what was listed and only changed what was absolutely neccessary for functionality

Changes to Controller from orginal design:
- removed updateView method and replaced with EqualsListener subclass
	there was no way around not having a listener in the Controller with previous team's implementation
	pretty sure previous team was expecting updateView to do the job of the listener, but that is not possible with just a method
	so we turned it into a subclass and named it appropriately as to make it easier on the next group and not confuse them
- removed classes Button, Label, Display, and Background that were likely supposed to go into View
	we think the previous team made a simple but big error in putting those classes in the Controller, so we go approval from an AI to simply move them as part of the View

No changes to Model needed.
