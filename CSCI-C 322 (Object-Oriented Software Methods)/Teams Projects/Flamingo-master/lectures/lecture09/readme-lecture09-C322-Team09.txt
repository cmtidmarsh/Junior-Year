 - Looked at the github code and copied it to local files.
 - First started by reviewing what our FSM looked like for last lecture and
   familiarized ourselves with the language it recognized
 - Chris started sharing his screen and we looked over the turnstile classes to
   see how we would implement our FSM in OOP
 - We decided to go with an individual class for each state (ex AP, BR, etc)
 - These contained methods from our abstract class
 - We had methods to read a zero, read a one, and accept and reject based on what state 
   we ended with
 - OOP example was very unintuitive and took a while to understand but is probably more 
   efficient in the long term. Procedural example was very simple and easy to understand 
   but was very hard coded.
