PARTS COMPLETED:
	We completed the entire thing. (Or, got a result for the entire thing.)

OBSERVATIONS:
	Immediately decided against Allie's A01 because it was not a good design overall and would be harder to adjust.
	Decided to use Michael's thanks to a very in-depth UML diagram that made everything very clear and therefore easy to work with.
	Recreating the UML diagram was tedious and we are still figuring out how RMI works.
	RMI Line divides Model and then View/Controller.
