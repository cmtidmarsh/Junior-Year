Team Flamingo
Lecture 16 Task
CSCI-C322 Spring 2021

We tried to use the beginning "Hello World" project for this task. We mainly manipulated the existing server/class files to work with our HelloWorld thing.
Our problems included a connectexception in which our connection request timed out/was refused. We also got lost among the changes we were making as we were flustered with the lack of time.
