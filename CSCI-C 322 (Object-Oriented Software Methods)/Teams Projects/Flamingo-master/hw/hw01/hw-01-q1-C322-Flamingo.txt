The binary system is a numerical system and only 0 and 1 are used by the binary system and every digit is referred to as a bit.
Compared to hexadecimal or octal, binary literals allow for a clearer relationship between data. 
The binary calculator in our homework is used to perform addition and subtraction of two binary numbers. 
The binary calculator is important because it simplifies the design of computers and related technologies by using them instead of the decimal method.

This is an emulator of a binary computer,
which can perform the addition and subtraction
of the binary numbers consists of "1" and "0".
The binary computer can also keep the result of
the previous operation as the first digit of the
current operation. This computer can clear zero can
also accumulate phase addition and subtraction.
The user can see the calculation process and result
in time on the display screen. This function of
retaining results is conducive to improving the
efficiency and accuracy of users' use. The input of
binary digits is prone to errors, and this automatic
retention function increases the user's convenience.

Description of Binary Calculcator App: The main functionality of the Binary Calculator is to calculate the sum or difference between to binary numbers.
This is useful because binary calculation isn't something that is practiced often by the average person and therefore would take a while to do without a calculator. Also,
computers can calculate most mathematical operations faster than any human, therefore this app would allow one to spend a  lot less time on these binary calculations.
