Evaluation for Team 11

Task 1:
-At lecture 17 time, submissions in the shared repository is organized
-At lecture 19 time, submissions in the shared repository is not organized (no submission): deduct -4%
-At lab 10 time, submissions in he shared repository is not organized (no submissions): deduct -2%

Task 2:
The UML's for lecture 19 and lab 10 are not present at all so They will recieve 0% for those two entries.

The UML for lecture 17 has an incorrect use and non-consistent use of arrows. It also does not clearly 
specify the distinction for the RMI. It is missing key aspects of the design that are required (such as the RMI).
It is not easy to follow and no written documentation to explain meaning is given. This UML would recieve a 60%
based on evaluation criteria.
