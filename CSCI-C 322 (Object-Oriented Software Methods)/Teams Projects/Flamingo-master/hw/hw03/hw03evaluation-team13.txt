Evaluation for Team 13

Task 1:
-At lab 10 the submission in the shared repository is organized
-At lecture 17 the submission in the shared repository is organized
-At lecture 18 the submission in the shared repository is organized


Task 2: 
For lab 10 the UML is really clear and arrows are used correctly. It is very clear where the RMI
would be placed and the logic is easy to follow. The UML should recieve a 100% based on the diagram 
evaluation criteria.

For lecture 17 the UML itself is somewhat hard to follow but all the parts are there. The notes and
text boxes added really help the understanding of the document and show the logic of the people who
produed it. All the design aspects that needed to be added were and the UML formatting was followed correctly.
The UML should recieve a 100% based on the diagram evaluation criteria.

Lecture 18 is very similar to lab 10. All the uml formatting is used correctly in terms of lines and arrows.
The RMI is very clearly shown within the UML diagram and the logic is easy to follow. All design aspects
that needed to be added are present. The UML should recieve a 100% based on the diagram evaluation criteria.
