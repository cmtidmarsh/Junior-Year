Team 15 Evaluation 
	Documentation: 100%

	Could have indicated which classes are part of the server vs the client, and maybe given
	a better description of the remote object interface.

	Total Points:
	1 * 0.5 + 0.8 * 0.5 = 90 % = 90/100
	
Team 16 Evaluation 
	Documentation: 90%
	Definitely weren't missing anything from the diagram but there was so much going on it was tough to follow
	and kind of unorganized.
	Specifications: 100%
	Plenty of detail and would be very easy for a developer to pick up and implement, although it probably could
	be simplified. 

	Total Points:
	0.9 * 0.5 + 1 * 0.5 = 95% = 95/100
