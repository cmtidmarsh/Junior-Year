# Binary Calculator

## Main Functionality

The calculator performs both addition and subtraction for binary numbers. Unlike typical calculators, the numbers being inputted will also be in binary, so the only digits that can be used are 0 and 1. Similarly, the output will also be in binary.

This sort of calculator could be useful when doing testing low-level programs, where the bit values of variables become more significant, or when using masks. For example, when mounting a drive on a Unix-based system, you can use bitmasks to set permissions for the files. With the `mount` command in particular, bitmasks are subtraction masks, where the mask is subtracted from 111 to get the resulting permission level.

This calculator would be able to assist in this sort of computation, ensuring that your calculations are correct.
