	1. UML Use CaseDiagrams 
		The diagram is clearly labelled and neat in presentation. There does not appear to be a reason to reduce points.
	2. 3 seperate UML Class Diagrams 
		There is only 1 of the 3 required diagrams, however it is suffiencnt in its documentation such that while this is not good code design, is functional.
		Therefore, we do not see a reason to reduce points.
	3. Brief Description 
		This description accurately describes what a binary caluclator is and what it is used for. Therefore we do not see a reason to reduce points
	4. UML State Diagram 
		This diagram is clearly labeled and neat in presentation. There does not appear to be a reason to reduce points.

Specification 47.7
	1. UML Use CaseDiagrams (turned in correctly)
		This diagram fulfills its function and fullfills specification. Therefore no point reduction.
	2. 3 seperate UML Class Diagrams (Turned in only 1 of 3)
		This diagram, as there is only 1 instead of the specified 3, loses points. Moreover, while it is functional design, is not what was asked. Therefore, we reduce 
		the total points for this submission by 66% or 8.3 points
	3. Brief Description (turned in correctly) 
		This desciption is exactly as it was asked. Therefore no point reduction.
	4. UML State Diagram (turned in correctly)
		This diagram is as specified and fulfils its funtion. Therefore no point reduction.
