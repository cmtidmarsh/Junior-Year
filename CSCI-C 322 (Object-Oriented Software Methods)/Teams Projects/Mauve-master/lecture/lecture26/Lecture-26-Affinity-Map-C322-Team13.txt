Zach's Questions:

- How can we deal with two people generating the same random ID?
  Answer: when we add it to the HashMap of players, if that ID already exists, increase the current playerID by 1 and store it.
  
- Should we also call updateResources based on a player picking up a resources, to prevent others from going to pick it up
  if the timer hasn't already updated the boar?
  Answer: Yes, we can call updateResources in the getResource method.
  
- Will we need to modify the RMI to begin the game, end the game, or to remove a player if he leaves?
  Answer: We likely will have to modify the RMI the begin the game, end the game, and deal with players leaving.
