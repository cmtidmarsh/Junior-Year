The biggest change we had to make from our original UML to the current one is the elimination of a Cell. The Cell class was how we stored
data about each Cell in the board, but since the interface returned an int[][], we dropped the usage of the Cell class and stored the data
with numbers in an int[][] instead. Otherwise, it was consistent with previous iterations of designing the game.
