C322 Student Team Feedback
-----------------------------
Which Team member contributed most to this assignment?
Adam
        
Which Team member contributed least to this assignment?
Probably me or Dean, i messed up on the player with resources so Adam went in and fixed it

Did anyone not contribute at all to this assignment?
No one, but almost me because of the arguement.
        
Are there any problems with your Team?

Problem 1:
Dean Allen and I had a huge fight about communication and work. On Thursday, I emailed both of my respected teammates stating that we were in a group
together for A03 and with my contact information. Later on that day, Adam Wittenberg texted me in response to my email (my phone number was listed as
a form of communication). We both agreed to wait to work on the assignment until either myself or Adam hears from Dean, so we can all be on the same
page and divide up the work. We waited the entire weekend and on Monday, I messaged Adam stating that I have not heard back from Dean but that we need
to get started on the assignment because we really could not wait any longer. Adam agreed and said that we should just divide up the work and then when
or if Dean replies we'll give him some work from each of ours. Exactly one minute after Adam texted me that message, I received a friend request on
Discord from Dean Allen (another form of contact that I mentioned in my email to them). He immediately messaged me "H!! Where are we at with A03 and how
can I help? thanks!" This message seemed like he figured we had already started and done a majority of the work and that he would just pop in and
contribute a little towards the end as A03 was supposed to be due on Wednedsay and he waited until Monday to get into contact with us even though
an email was sent out on Thursday to at least start coordinating the assignment. I immediately made a group chat on Discord consisting of all of the team members to start
coordinating. We all said that we were free to meet on Tuesday after 3pm. Then on Tuesday, at 10:13 AM Dean messaged the chat asking if we could meet at 6PM. I asked if we could
meet earlier because it was due in a little over 24 hours and that we hadn't even started working on it because we were waiting to get into contact will all members to
coordinate and be on the same page to divide the work up equally. He then mentioned that he was busy until 6PM even though the day before we all said we were free after 3PM.
After our meeting, he then delegated the work to each: Adam (player interaction with other players), Dean (timer), and Clare (player interaction with resources). Today (04/28)
at 10:45AM he messaged us asking to meet at 12PM to finish the assignment. I told him that I was free but that the due date was extended to Sunday, so we really need to use it
because we lost Friday-Monday to work on it. He mentioned that he wanted to try to finish the assignment in the meeting at 12PM. Adam then messaged saying that he works on
Mondays/Wednesdays so he is not free until after lecture time, which is completely fine. But then Dean got defensive after I mentioned that  we need to use the extension because
he didn't message us all weekend to talk about starting the assignment. He said not to blame him for not emailing me back and that I could have started it without him. However,
since this is a TEAM assignment, Adam and I agreed to get into connect with everyone in the group before starting so we all could contribute equally and be on the same page with
each other. I don't think it's unreasonable to wait to start a team assignment until everyone in the team knows what is going on and who implements what methods. However, he has
absolutely no regards for my schedule as well as Adam's schedule as we have been having to wait on him and then work around his schedule. I find this situation very insulting
and disrespectful as he made it seem as though he intentionally waited to contact us not even 48 hours before the assignment is due asking where we are at and if there's 
anything he can do to help. I have all of the discord and text message receipts from both Adam and Dean. 

April 22,2021 (Imessage: Adam to Clare)
Adam: Hey Clare, this is Adam Wittenberg from C322, jsut wanted to let you know I saw your message. I was swamped with work yesterday so I couldn't
make lecture but we can coordinate assignment 03 once we all communicate with our whole group. Let me know if you have any contact from our other
team member.
Clare: I do not
[April 26, 2021] Clare: Hey I haven't heard back from Dean Allen but we really should start working on the assignment this week.
Adam: Hey okay that's interesting lol, well just have to work on it us two then till we hear from him. Pretty busy today but I'll have some more time
tomorrow if you just want to split up the implementation. I can start with the Timer and player interaction with resources and then you can take the
other two if that works for you.
Clare: I actually just got a friend request on discord from him.

April 26, 2021 (Discord: Dean to Clare)

[5:23 PM] Cmeichuan: im free all day tomorrow
[5:25 PM] deanthing: @Adam Wittenberg wby
[6:04 PM] Cmeichuan: damnit Dean, I was gonna use the decorator pattern as a general equation and the types of lines you can make
[6:05 PM] Cmeichuan: :((((
[6:27 PM] deanthing: im sure you could say something similar in different words
[6:28 PM] Cmeichuan: nah nah have to be original
[9:11 PM] Adam Wittenberg: I’m free pretty much all day after 3 tomorrow


April 27, 2021 (Discord: Group Chat- Dean, Clare, Adam)
[10:13 AM] deanthing: can we meet at 6 today?
[11:42 AM] Cmeichuan: Can we meet earlier? It’s due tomorrow and hopefully they give an extension but we really need to start
[1:01 PM] deanthing: im personally  not free until 6
[1:01 PM] deanthing: if you guys are free we can work on it at 6 for an hour or two


April 28, 2021 (Discord: Group Chat- Dean, Clare, Adam)
[10:45 AM] deanthing: are you guys free to meet at 12 today?
[10:50 AM] Cmeichuan: Yeah
[10:50 AM] Cmeichuan: Also, idk if you guys heard but the due date was extended to Sunday
[11:03 AM] deanthing: thats kinda hype, id be down to try and finish it today tho. i have so much work due this weekend.
[11:23 AM] Cmeichuan: I get that you’re busy because we all are, but you should’ve contact us before Monday when I emailed the both of you on Thursday. I only heard back from
Adam over the weekend. I don’t think finishing this assignment today is a good idea. We really need to use this extension to go over every detail since we didn’t even start this
over the weekend.
[12:06 PM] Adam Wittenberg: Hey guys sorry I’m just seeing this I work mondays/wednesdays most of the day up until lecture so I’m not even home. I have my piece pretty much done
was just waiting to commit till we figured out how to do the gather resources. If you guys can get close on the other 3 I can try and wrap it up tonight after lecture and also
I’ll write up our UML once we’re done, think we got a good start yesterday though
[1:22 PM] deanthing: i just said "id be down to try and finish it today", you dont have to blame me for not emailing you back over the weekend, you could have started without
me. like i said, i have a lot of work this weekend but i can still wait to meet if you guys are busy
[1:23 PM] deanthing: @Cmeichuan are you saying you're not going to be able to do the gather resources part?
[1:25 PM] Cmeichuan: When did I ever say that
[1:26 PM] Cmeichuan: I’m not blaming you, but it’s not very professional to start without everyone on the same page. Correct? We were waiting so we could split up the fucking work.
[1:28 PM] Cmeichuan: I have a fucking fever, I told you I pushed some yesterday and that I was gonna work on it today. There’s a second part to the assignment, the administrator
[1:34 PM] deanthing: okay well when do you want to meet?
[1:38 PM] deanthing: its professional to not say "fucking" in every sentence as well though :innocent:
[1:42 PM] Cmeichuan: Can you read? I said it twice.
[1:43 PM] Cmeichuan: was it professional of you to message me on Monday asking what there is left to do? No
[1:43 PM] deanthing: look idk why you're angry and swearing a lot but im just trying to finish this assignment. let me know when you're free and want to meet.
[1:44 PM] deanthing: i think adam said he's busy all today but im free thurs and friday to work on it but im going out of town this weekend so it will have be before then
[1:57 PM] Cmeichuan: You know why I’m mad. I emailed the two of you on Thursday. One got back on Thursday and said that we should wait until we get a hold of all group members.
We waited the entire weekend for a response because sits a team assignment and that point is to work together as a team. We were going to start the assignment because we
couldn’t wait any longer then that’s when you messaged me asking where we were at in the assignment and how you can help. You obviously thought we would have done most of the
work by the time Monday rolled around because it was assigned on Wednesday and it was due on Wednesday but we didn’t hear from you not even 48 hours until it was due. We’ve
literally scheduled around you. I don’t know how Adam is feeling about this, he might not care, but it’s disrespectful to not allow adequate time to even communicate then say
“let’s try to get it done by tonight because I’m busy”. And then you messaging us a hour or two because you wanted to meet today makes it seem like you don’t care about our
schedules but rather just yourself. If you wanted to meet at 12 today, you should’ve at least mentioned that in the group chat last night giving people enough time to arrange
schedules. Like I said, we’ve literally waited for you and adjusted to your schedule. Why should I continue doing that? This is now due on Sunday and because we lost last
Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday on it we really should use the full extension to complete the assignment.
[1:59 PM] deanthing: Bet let’s meet on your time.  When should we meet?
[2:01 PM] Cmeichuan: Wednesday: 7pm, Thursday: all day, Friday: until 6pm, Saturday: none, Sunday: all day.


Problem 2:
I asked multiple times about implementing the Observer and either the simple factory or decorator pattern because I wanted to know which two
we chose as a team to implement. My questions were ignored on where to implement them until a couple hours until the assignment was due,
all contact between Dean and myself have been very aggressive on both sides and now we're scrambling to finish because Dean has been M.I.A. for
most of the time that we were given until the day of the due date.


Personally, I don't deserve a good grade on A03 because why should I put in more work and let someone else hop in to benefit off the two who were
trying to work as a team, especially the middle after an arguement like the ones described above. I feel like our time is meaningless to one of the
members on the team and since the beginning, the rest have been on his time only.
