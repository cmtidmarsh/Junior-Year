C322 Student Team Feedback
        Which Team member contributed most to this assignment?
        Probably Zach.
        
        Zach - started implementation from design documents, in charge of majority user drawing/movement (coding aspects), looked over/suggested changes to uml.
        Clare - started UML, was in charge of the majority of uml, documented any and all changes in README as well as took notes,
                        created student contract (everyone electronically signed), and additions and suggestions to code implementation in the player, player decorator,
                        some (very little of) model.
        Daniel - in charge of server, model (and I believe another java file), implemented methods that were intitialized but not yet implemented around the entire project
                 file, looked over/suggested changes to uml, and made revisions to methods that someone already implemented but did not necessarily work. 
       
       
       Which Team member contributed least to this assignment?
        I really hate picking someone because we all try to contribute equally, so I'll choose myself or Daniel.
        
        Did anyone not contribute at all to this assignment?
        No.
        
        Are there any problems with your Team?
        Not really, times to meet up was a hassle. Some of us prefered to code individually, while others tried
        to work together. However, it is hard to all code on one server unless you use programs like codebunk to
        collab, which we did not and could not due to the assignment that was given. I don't believe it's possible
        to use programs like that for this given assignment.
