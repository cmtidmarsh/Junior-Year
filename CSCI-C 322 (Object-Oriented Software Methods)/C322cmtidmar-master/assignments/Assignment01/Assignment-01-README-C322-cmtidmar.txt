C322 Student A01-Team 04 Feedback
-----------------------------------

Which Team member contributed most to this assignment?
Clare Tidmarsh

Which Team member contributed least to this assignment?
Ploy Unchit

Did anyone not contribute at all to this assignment?
Alexander Smith (dropped class)

Are there any problems with your Team?
By Alexander dropping the class mid-assignment, it really put us back in our implementation portion of the assignment.
Ploy's schedule and my schedule did not exactly aligin well as she would be busy whenever I was free and vice versa.
I think figuring out how to complete the assignment was the biggest drawback because we would never have time to meet together
and there was no third person to split the work with. I believe I ended up doing most of the assignment because I really wanted
to start it so we didn't have to spend too much time together by creating the project rather than working on the methods itself.
I didn't have any  problems with Ploy while working with her, other than scheduling. She's a really nice and intelligent person
to work with. I just think our team suddenly dropping a person in the midst of the assignment really got to the both of us and
caught us off guard. I believe if we would have known sooner, than we could've sheduled our week better to work on it together.
