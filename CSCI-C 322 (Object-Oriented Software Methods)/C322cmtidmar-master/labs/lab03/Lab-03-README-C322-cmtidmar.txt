Today, I have completed all steps to the lab. To perform the lab, I started by cloning
the Head First Design Patterns folder from the C322 class repo onto my computer. I then opened intelliJ
and created a new project called C322Ducks. From there, in the src folder of the project, I created a new package 
also called C322Ducks. Within the package, I copied all of the files in the subfolder called "Ducks" from the cloned
repo. I then ran the main methods in the DuckTestDrive.java and the TurkeyTestDrive.java. After running, I copied the
outputs from those two testdrive files onto a txt doc called Lab03output.txt.

Discussion with team (Team 3): I noticed that Will Boland's diagram was simpler and cleaner than mine and Christian 
Dummer's. Will mentioned that the different arrows used have different meanings, it is obvious to me that he has at least
some previous experience in UML diagrams or can pick them up very easily. Christian's diagram arguably is a little more
difficult to read and understand when comparing his UML diagram to Christians or mine. However, after going over the diagram,
I understand the relationships of each classes more indepth when it comes to tying the turkey classes with the duck classes,
whereas, Will does not tie the two interfaces together but instead leaves them separate without a relationship between the two
interfaces.
