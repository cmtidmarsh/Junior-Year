C322 Student Team Feedback
---------------------------
In your individual README file, briefly provide some feedback about the work in your Student Team, by answering the following questions:

Which Team member contributed most to this Lab 07 task?
Nolan Cauley, was the one who screenshared the project and did the actual RMI implementations. I don't know how we can help, when you're
just working off of the previous Lab to convert the current to resemble the previous.
Richard wrote the Team README.

Which Team member contributed least to this Lab 07 task?
Me! I gave some input about what we need to make what classes part of the RMI and the contents
and started writing the three paragraphs but then we decided to not change the design so I just deleted what I had.


Did anyone not contribute at all to this Lab 07 task?
No.

Are there any problems with your Team?
No.
