C322 Student Team Feedback
---------------------------
In your individual README file, briefly provide some feedback about the work in your Student Team, by answering the following questions:

Which Team member contributed most to this Lab 07 task?
Nolan Cauley, worked on it before lab. I was told this when we got in, which isn't a bad idea, we've been working on the error together
and how to properly run it through terminal.

Which Team member contributed least to this Lab 07 task?
Richard Caraher

Did anyone not contribute at all to this Lab 07 task?
During lab time Richard Caraher was absent.

Are there any problems with your Team?
No, did someone talk to them? Beca use the past two days they have been nonstop asking for my advice and wording it very weirdly
and the past two weeks they never did.
