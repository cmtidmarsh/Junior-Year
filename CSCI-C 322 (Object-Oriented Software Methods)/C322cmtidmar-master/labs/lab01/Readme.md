Notes in installation:

Very easy, as I have used IU Github in the past.
I just built a new PC in October and really haven't done any coding on it besides my Mac, so hopefully I installed everything correctly on the PC.
Lab tasks were very straight forward today.
I think I also made the repo correctly as private as seen on the documentation, but I saw some people made their repo "internal" so is it supposed to be private or internal?
