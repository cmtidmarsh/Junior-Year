C322 Student Team Feedback
---------------------------
In your individual README file, briefly provide some feedback about the work in your Student Team, by answering the following questions:

Which Team member contributed most to this Lab 07 task?
Probably Nolan Cauley, since he had the code up on screen sharing.
Which Team member contributed least to this Lab 07 task?
Probably me, I created most of the classes on the UML Class Diagram and some of the connections, but
I think Richard created the Team README file and Nolan screen shared the code that we tried to fix
as well as all of us working on the UML.
I definitely figured out 
the bugs we needed to fix on the code on my own like two seconds before Nolan discovered it. 
But he confirmed that
it works so I just kept quiet.

Did anyone not contribute at all to this Lab 07 task?
No.

Are there any problems with your Team?
They might say I was really quiet, I only communicate when I have something to say about or ask. 
So if they mention a problem it's probably me and being quiet/sounding really down.
