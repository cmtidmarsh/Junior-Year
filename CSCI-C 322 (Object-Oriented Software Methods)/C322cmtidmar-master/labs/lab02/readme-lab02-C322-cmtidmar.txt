"Every student also needs to turn in an individual README plain-text file named 'readme-lab02-C322-yourusername.txt' in which you explain:
since you're part of a 3-student to 4-student team, list your team members (their first and last name, and IU email address)
your own personal feedback you may have about your team members, e.g. please explain if anyone from your team didn't contribute to today's Lab 02 task; or if anyone did extra work, etc.
the parts of the lab you have completed;
any interesting parts you may have added;
(optional) any question you may have about the tasks, or any issue you may have encountered with the software tools you used"

We built off of our previous diagram from lecture 03.  We did not add any interesting features but rather intially made a diagram for view, controller, and model. Then when we 
were informed by a UI that we did it wrong, he sent an example link to help guide up on the correct path. Teammates were good, no one slacked off or anything. There was one person
who really knew what they were doing and he helped explained any questions I or the other person may have had in the process.
