C322 Lab04 Team Feedback:
Which Team member contributed most to this Lab 04 task?
 Christian Dummer created the project and added the files. 
 Clare fixed an error in the main method and gave ideas/input on how to fix on an incorrect output.
 Will also gave input throughout the lab on what we could do.
 
Which Team member contributed least to this Lab 04 task?
Since Christian created the project, we didn't feel the need to upload it then all pull it to work on it individually.
Instead, Christian did the typing, Will and I gave our own ideas on how to solve the lab tasks. It was fairly simple, so 
Will and I felt as though we didn't do as much since we didnt have the file. The AI's also suggested that one person types 
and the others give input on how to complete the tasks. 

Did anyone not contribute at all to this Lab 04 task?
No.

Are there any problems with your Team?
No.
