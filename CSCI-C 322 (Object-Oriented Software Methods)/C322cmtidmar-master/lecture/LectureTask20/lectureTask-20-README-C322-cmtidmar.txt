Which Team member contributed least to this task?
Idk, probably me, I didnt have enough time to type out all of my questions then discuss them with the group so I
just tpyed a couple before the break out groups closed.
Did anyone not contribute at all to this task?
No.
Are there any problems with your Team?
No, but I dont think we really had enough time to write all questions and then list them. 
Maybe 10 minutes instead of 5 wouuld be enough time



Lecture Task A

5 questions
-----------
In what ways does the Forager game is similar to the Game of Life? <- in affinity map
Do neighboring cells have similar life and death rules since it is a game of resources? <- in affinity map
Is each player a "cow", if so, how many minimum cows can there be? <- not in affinity map
Are the players randomized or do they pick where they can place themselves? <- not in affinity map
How do we distinquish between the levels of resources? By color? Marker? Etc. <- not in affinity map

The break out groups closed before I could type the questions that were "not in affinity map" to the team
