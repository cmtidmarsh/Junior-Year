*Evaluate groups 14, 15, 16, 17*

Evaluation:
Which teams are you evaluating?
Your team number +1, +2, +3, +4, (modulo 18)
Which specifications are you evaluating?
As from Lab 10, Lecture 18, and Lecture 17.
What documentation criteria are you evaluating?
As from UML Class Diagram references listed at Lecture 01.
Read through the entire Homework 03 document. We started on out draft of evaluations:
Team 14:
Evaluate the organization of the assigned four teams submissions in the file/directory structure. Points you're determining for this part: exponential deduction.

Lecture 17: Not Organized: has Lecture18.pdf without an explanation as to why Lecture 17 has a Lecture 17 diagram as well as the Lecture 18 diagram. For someone merely looking at the files without context, it raises the question why and the relevance for Lecture 18 diagram being in Lecture 17’s folder and in Lecture 18’s folder too. Also, the naming-convention for Lecture 17 task seems to be off as “Lecture 17 Real.pdf” does not seem to follow guidelines, also, what’s “real”? -2%

Lecture 18: TBD

Lab 10: Not Organized: contains code for lab 10 instead of simply the design documents. -8%

*Need to do*
Evaluate the Design: the UML diagram and the description of the remote object interface, as prepared by the previous team for their Lab 10. Points you're determining for this part: 100 points.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Team 15:
Evaluate the organization of the assigned four teams submissions in the file/directory structure. Points you're determining for this part: exponential deduction.

Lecture 17: Organized: everything in Lab10 was properly named with code in an appropriate, distinct folder.

Lecture 18: TBD

Lab 10: Not Organized: Does not contain the team readme for lab 10 in the appropriate folder.

*Need to do*
Evaluate the Design: the UML diagram and the description of the remote object interface, as prepared by the previous team for their Lab 10. Points you're determining for this part: 100 points.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Team 16:
Evaluate the organization of the assigned four teams submissions in the file/directory structure. Points you're determining for this part: exponential deduction

Lecture 17: Organized properly with the Team README and the Team UML Diagram. Appropriate content is also in both files as well as proper file names.

Lecture 18: TBD

Lab 10:

*Need to do*
Evaluate the Design: the UML diagram and the description of the remote object interface, as prepared by the previous team for their Lab 10. Points you're determining for this part: 100 points.

	Lecture 17: Not Organized: lecture 17 folder contains UML documentation for the 
lecture 18 task. 

Lecture 18: Not Organized: lecture 18 folder contains no documentation, missing both a UML diagram and a readme.

Lab 10: Not Organized: Lab 10 folder contains no UML diagram or README file.

Evaluate the Design: the UML diagram and the description of the remote object interface, as prepared by the previous team for their Lab 10. Points you're determining for this part: 100 points.
