Left lecture due to presentation anxiety/in tears.

(I understand if lecture points cannot be given for this lecture, but at least something
will be turned in).

Affinity Map
------------

-generatePlayer():
On Piazza, it was suggested that this.hashCode() method works to always generate a new,
unique id code. Why is your implementation more efficient than what was answered on
Piazza?

t's stated that it's highly unlikely that two of the same numbers will be generated but
in the event that it does, is a helper function necessary in the event, or how would it be
handled in your team's perspective, since you stated the possibility but no solution.

When you have each Player generate a random number, will the player/user generate it/will 
generate it theirself or when a new user logs onto the server, will a random number be assigned
automatically?

-Time implementation:
Last lecture, a handful of teams came up with 5 seconds, why is 3 seconds long enough for resources
to disappear/respawn?

Would the clock be on only the server side or the server and client side as well (client side from
Team 5's documents)?
