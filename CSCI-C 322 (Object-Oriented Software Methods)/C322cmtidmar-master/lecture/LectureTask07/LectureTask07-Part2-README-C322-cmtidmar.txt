(Clare -> Team 4: Looks good! A lot of actions/properties of bank accounts)

1. Bank>Bank Account Factory> Saving Account/Checking Account 
2. Saving and Checking account = concrete , BankAccount = abstract
3. The properties will go in each subclass of checking and saving account containing Withdraw, Deposit, and amount. Checking and Saving will have the unique attributes, i.e. pin, account number, etc.
