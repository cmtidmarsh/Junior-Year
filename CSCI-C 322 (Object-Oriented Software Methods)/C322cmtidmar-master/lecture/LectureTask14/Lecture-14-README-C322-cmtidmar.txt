No.

Are there any problems with your Team?
They seem like they don't listen to me, I didn't agree with how they wanted to use the update() method
from the observer. They want to put all of the rules in that update() method that is automatically implemented
in the Controller, but I don't think they belong there. I think the rules belong in the Cell class.
But they really don't listen, because I answered a question that one of them asked and one of them literally said the
same answer that's when they agreed. Ever since we started as a team, they literally don't give me the time of day
besides one time. I really don't like working with them.
