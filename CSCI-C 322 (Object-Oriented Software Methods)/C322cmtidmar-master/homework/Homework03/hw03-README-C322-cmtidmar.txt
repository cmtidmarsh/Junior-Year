Feedback for Parts A and B
--------------------------
Organization is fairly easy to determine. Looking at the file name conventions and the content within those files it's not difficult to
properly organize a folder. However, looking at the different teams, it is clear that many are confused as to exactly what files need to be submitted.
One group submitted a file from their project, some of the groups submitted a team README in the C322 Team Documentations folder, and some did not.
Next time, I think having a list that students can see of exactly what files are required for full submission for that assignment/homework/task is necessary.
I think the list at the very beginning of each task/homework/assignment wil be beneficial so students do not miss out on any points from a simple misunderstanding.
But throughout each team, it is clear who strives at UML Diagrams and who still needs some work on them. That is not an issue, but the closer a UML diagram is to
being right (in terms of organization of content and content in it) helps significantly future teams as well as is a good skill for future work endeavers.
