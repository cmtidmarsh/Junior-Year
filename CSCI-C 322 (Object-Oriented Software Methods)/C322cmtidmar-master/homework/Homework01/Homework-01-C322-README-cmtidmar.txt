Team 3: Will Boland, Clare Tidmarsh, Christian Dummer

Notes:  We each took one UML class diagram to do separately. I did the controller diagram of the class diagram.
One of the boys took the UML case diagram as well as his class diagram. Since he did that, myself and the other
student completed the UML Activity diagram together. After a few days of allowing time to work, we then came together
to look at and discuss each other's work. The two boys then combined the separate UML class diagrams together to 
create one big diagram in order to show the relations of each: the model, the view, and the controller. Whilst they did
that, I typed up the brief description that was also required for submission. After writing the description, I allowed
the others in the group to check over it to finalize what I had typed. Christian Dummer then compiled everything onto
one document for submission. He was the one who pushed everything to our Brunswick repo.

C322 Team 3 Feedback
-----------------
Which Team member contributed most to this assignment?
We all completed a similar amount as I was very adoment on having the work be a 33% for each person. However, in the end,
Christian Dummer was the one who pasted all of the graphs and description onto a document and submitted. But one person has
to that anyways, if you're taking that into account, then Christian. 

Which Team member contributed least to this assignment?

Clare Tidmarsh - 1.5 diagram (activity and controller class), application description
Will Boland - 1.5 diagram (view class and activity)
Christian Dummer - 2.5 diagram (case, model class, and activity), compiled all graphs and description together, submitted team assignment to repo 

Did anyone not contribute at all to this assignment?
No.

Are there any problems with your Team?
Not really any problems, communication was a bit slow getting started but once we figured out who is doing what, it was fairly smooth from there.
